# Autonomous Line-Following Buggy – PID Speed Control

## Overview
This project is a team-based university engineering project involving the design and implementation of an autonomous buggy using an Arduino microcontroller.

The system implements closed-loop PID speed control, allowing the buggy to track a user-defined target velocity (e.g. 15 cm/s).

A Java-based desktop user interface communicates with the Arduino to set parameters and monitor behaviour.
